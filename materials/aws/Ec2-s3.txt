cat /etc/rc.local

--whatever written in this file, the commands will get executed 
  everytime the machine reboots.
  
so i will write the command in there

java -jar /home/ec2-user/couponservice-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

{assuming jar is copied into /home/ec2-user from s3}

then we need to do

chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Nowadays when you bring a new ec2 server up
run,

amazon-linux-extras install epel -y

=========
stress command
=========
yum install stress -Y

stress is used to do load testing on ec2 instance

==========
Create AMI
==========

1. Select EC2 instance.
2. Select Actions -> Create -> Create Image
3. Give image name: couponservice
4. while creating image, snapshot of the actual ec2 storage will be created.
